### Homework Instructions
1. Create a new project;
2. Write Verilog source files (module and testbench), description of the demultiplexer as shown below using case statements. Saved the Verilog description as q3_xxxxxxx.v, and q3_tb_xxxxxxx.v;
3. The specifications of the demultiplexer are:
  - It is a 1-to-4 demultiplexer.
  - Input A and outputs W, X, Y, and Z are all 2-bit vectors.
  - SEL is a 2-bit select input.
  - Each of the 4 combinations of SEL will determine which of the 4 outputs will receive the value of input A.
  - When one output is equal to A, all other outputs are equal to ‘0’.
